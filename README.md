# xn-resource-editor
Import from https://sourceforge.net/projects/xn-resource-editor/ which is the original source of the xn-resource-editor by Colin Wilson with additions from [@dummzeuch](https://github.com/dummzeuch).

# Original description
This repository is meant to finally build a compiling and working source of Colin Wilson's XN Resource Editor. The sources widely available on the Net are not complete, they are missing several prerequisites. Once I get everything together I will compile a new executable and maybe even improve the program a bit.
